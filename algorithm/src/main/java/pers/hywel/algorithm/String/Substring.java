/**
 * Description:
 * Substring with Concatenation of All Words【hard】
 *
 * 给定的一个词组数组构成的字符串（顺序可打乱），在母字符串s中是否存在该子串的位置
 * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices
 * of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening
 * characters.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 *   s = "barfoothefoobarman",
 *   words = ["foo","bar"]
 * Output: [0,9]
 * Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
 * The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
