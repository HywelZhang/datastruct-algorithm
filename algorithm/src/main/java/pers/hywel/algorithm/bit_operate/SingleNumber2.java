/**
 * 137. Single Number II【Medium】
 *
 * Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one,
 * which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
 *
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 * Output: 99
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104p
 * -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 * Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
 *
 * 每个数都重复三次的数组里，找到那个只出现一次的数字。时间和空间都O(n)
