/**
 * Description:
 * 1540. Can Convert String in K Moves
 * Medium
 * Given two strings s and t, your goal is to convert s into t in k moves or less.
 * <p>
 * During the ith (1 <= i <= k) move you can:
 * <p>
 * Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
 * Do nothing.
 * Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.
 * <p>
 * Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.
 * <p>
 * Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "input", t = "ouput", k = 9
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: In the 6th move, we shift 'i' 6 times to get 'o'. And in the 7th move we shift 'n' to get 'u'.
