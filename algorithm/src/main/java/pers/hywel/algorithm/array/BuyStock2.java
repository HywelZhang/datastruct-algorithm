/**
 * Description:
 * 买股票2
 * 给一个数组，可以多次交易，怎么获取最大值
 *
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
 * Solution
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one
 * and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy
 * again).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 *              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
